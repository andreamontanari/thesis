# Andrea Montanari - Bachelor research thesis in Computer Science (University of Udine)
This is my personal bachelor thesis space.
<br>

<br>
<br>
You can find 2 main folders: <b>PersonalSolution</b> and <b>MyThesis</b>
<ul>
<li>PersonalSolution represents the general solution to the icon placing problem avoiding overlappings
<li>MyThesis is the main part of the thesis, involved in solving the problem for specific mobile apps
