# Andrea Montanari - Bachelor research thesis in Computer Science (University of Udine)
This is my personal bachelor thesis space.
<br>
I am working on a research thesis based on mobile maps (Android) and icon placement.
<br>
<br>
You can find 2 main folders: <b>PersonalSolution</b> and <b>MyThesis</b>
<ul>
<li>PersonalSolution represents the general solution to the icon placing problem avoiding overlappings
<li>MyThesis is the main part of the thesis, involved in solving the problem for specific mobile apps
<br>
<br>
MyThesis has 3 options: Demo1, Demo2 or Demo3.
<br>
Demo1 is the non optimised version of my solution (devices just download the information from the server)
<br>
Demo2 is the client-side optimised version of my solution
<br>
Demo3 is still work in progress, trying to achieve the server-side version!
