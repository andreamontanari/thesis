# Andrea Montanari - Bachelor research thesis in Computer Science (University of Udine)
This is my personal bachelor thesis space.
<br>
I am working on a research thesis based on mobile maps (Android) and icon placement.
<br>
<br>
You can find 2 main folders: <b>PersonalSolution</b> and <b>MyThesis</b>
<ul>
<li>PersonalSolution represents the general solution to the icon placing problem avoiding overlappings
<li>MyThesis is the main part of the thesis, involved in solving the problem for specific mobile apps
</ul>
<br>
<br>
MyThesis has 4 options: Demo1, Demo2, Demo3 or Demo 4.
<br>
Demo1 is the non optimised version of my solution (devices just download the information from the server) in a simple way
<br>
Demo2 is the optimised client-side version of my solution in the simplier way
<br>
Demo3 is the non-otpimised version of my solution in the real use case!
<br>
Demo4 is the optimised client-side version of my solution in the real use case, adapting the algorith of minimum aggegation to reach good results!
